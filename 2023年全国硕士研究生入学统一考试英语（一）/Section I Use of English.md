This word "caravanserais" is a **<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>** of the Persian word "kārvān", which means a group of travellers or a caravan, and "sarāy" , a palace or enclosed building. The term caravan was used to **<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>** groups of people who travelled together across the ancient network for safety reasons, **<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>** merchants, travellers or pillgrims.

From the 10th century onwards, as merchant and travel routes became more developed, the **<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>** of the caravanserais increased and they served as a safe place for people to rest at night.

Caravanserais were also an important marketplace for commodities and **<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;15&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>** in the trade of goods along the Silk Road. **<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;16&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>** , it was frequently the first stop for merchants looking to sell their wares and **<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;17&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>** supplies for their own journeys. It is **<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;18&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>** that around 12,000 to 15,000 caravanserais were built along the Silk Road, **<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;19&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>** only about 3 , 000 are known to remain today, many of which are in **<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;20&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>**.
